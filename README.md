## Global Alignment with Scoring Matrix and Affine Gap Penalty (In development)

## Development Notes

* Every Rosalind node should have its own file in the format ```ACRN.py``` (Put inside algorithms folder) 
  where ```ACRN``` is the acronym for the node in the tree view
  
* Name the main function in each node main_XXX, eg. main function in ```ACRN.py``` should be ```main_ACRN(...)```

* Name testing function test_function_name, eg. for ```ACRN.py``` -> ```test_ACRN.py```
  
* multiple tests per function, first two positive, last one negative

* unit test doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

* use of doc string: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
