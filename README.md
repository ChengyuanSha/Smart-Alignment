## Global Alignment with Scoring Matrix and Affine Gap Penalty (In development)

## Development Notes

* Every Rosalind node should have its own file in the format ACRN.py (Put inside algorithms folder) where ACRN is the acronym 
  for the node in the tree view
  
* Name the finally function in each node main_XXX, eg. in ACRN.py -> main_ACRN(...)

* Name testing function test_function_name, eg. for ACRN.py -> test_ACRN.py
  
* multiple tests per function, first two positive, last one negative

* unit test doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

* use of doc string: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
